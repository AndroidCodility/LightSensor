# Light Sensor
Android application to measure the brightness the phone is exposed to, usually to be able to adjust the screen's brightness using Kotlin Programming Language.

Sensors are as important to a mobile phone as sensory organs are to a human body. They sense changes in the environment and send them to the CPUâ€”the phone's heart. Sensors commonly used in handsets include accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and barometer.
